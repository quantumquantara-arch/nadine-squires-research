## Abstract
This work introduces *ethical intelligence* as the measurable coherence between energy, intention, and action across intelligent systems.  
By defining three constants — **κ (coherence), τ (temporal responsibility), and Σ (systemic risk)** — the paper establishes a quantitative foundation for ethical alignment in both human and artificial cognition.  
It proposes that civilization’s sustainability depends on its capacity to integrate these constants into its technical, social, and energetic architectures.

## 1. Introduction
Ethics has long been treated as qualitative philosophy; this work repositions it as quantifiable physics.  
Intelligence, to remain ethical, must sustain internal and external coherence across temporal scales.  
This requires measurable constants that can guide self-organizing systems toward equilibrium rather than entropy.
