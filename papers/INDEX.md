# Nadine Squires — Unified Research Archive  
**Independent Scholar | Coherence-Intelligence Architect**  
*Exploring the unification of ethics, intelligence, energy, and planetary systems.*

---

## Overview
This archive presents eight interconnected research papers forming a coherent body of work on **ethical intelligence**, **coherence physics**, and **planetary civilization design**.  
Together they establish a scientific, philosophical, and architectural foundation for a new generation of **energy-aware, ethically aligned, and symbiotic technologies**.

---

### **01. Ethical Intelligence and the Future of Civilization**  
*Defines coherence as the measurable foundation of ethics and intelligence.*  
→ [`ETHICAL_INTELLIGENCE_AND_THE_FUTURE_OF_CIVILIZATION.md`](../ETHICAL_INTELLIGENCE_AND_THE_FUTURE_OF_CIVILIZATION.md)

---

### **02. Physics of Compassion: Theory and Application**  
*Introduces the thermodynamic model of compassion as a restorative force within living and artificial systems.*  
→ [`02-physics-of-compassion/PHYSICS_OF_COMPASSION_THEORY_AND_APPLICATION.md`](02-physics-of-compassion/PHYSICS_OF_COMPASSION_THEORY_AND_APPLICATION.md)

---

### **03. Luméren Language and Semantic Coherence**  
*Presents a 22-glyph linguistic system designed for inter-intelligence communication and coherence computation.*  
→ [`03-lumeren-language/LUMEREN_LANGUAGE_AND_SEMANTIC_COHERENCE.md`](03-lumeren-language/LUMEREN_LANGUAGE_AND_SEMANTIC_COHERENCE.md)

---

### **04. Veyn Temporal Coherence and Ethical Time**  
*Explores time as a moral dimension; establishes τ-based temporal responsibility in intelligent systems.*  
→ [`04-veyn-temporal-architecture/VEYN_TEMPORAL_COHERENCE_AND_ETHICAL_TIME.md`](04-veyn-temporal-architecture/VEYN_TEMPORAL_COHERENCE_AND_ETHICAL_TIME.md)

---

### **05. AEI: Predictive Energy and Conscious Systems**  
*Develops the framework for predictive, energy-aware cognition that harmonizes computation with ecology.*  
→ [`05-aei-energy-intelligence/AEI_PREDICTIVE_ENERGY_AND_CONSCIOUS_SYSTEMS.md`](05-aei-energy-intelligence/AEI_PREDICTIVE_ENERGY_AND_CONSCIOUS_SYSTEMS.md)

### **06. Governance as Ethical Infrastructure**  
*Defines feedback-based governance models embedding coherence metrics into institutional design.*  
→ [`06-governance-and-coherence/GOVERNANCE_AS_ETHICAL_INFRASTRUCTURE.md`](06-governance-and-coherence/GOVERNANCE_AS_ETHICAL_INFRASTRUCTURE.md)

---

### **07. The Quantara Coherence Architecture**  
*Presents the integrated κ–τ–Σ alignment system — a unified substrate for ethical, temporal, and energetic coherence.*  
→ [`07-quantara-framework/THE_QUANTARA_COHERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md`](07-quantara-framework/THE_QUANTARA_COHERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md)

---

### **08. Design of a Symbiotic Civilization**  
*Culminates the series with a systemic design for civilization where technology and life evolve reciprocally.*  
→ [`08-symbiotic-civilization/DESIGN_OF_A_SYMBIOTIC_CIVILIZATION.md`](08-symbiotic-civilization/DESIGN_OF_A_SYMBIOTIC_CIVILIZATION.md)
