## Overview  
Humanity has advanced in computation, prediction, and automation, yet it lacks a class of foundational algorithms needed for a stable, self-aligning civilization. This collection introduces ten missing algorithmic primitives designed to maintain coherence across cognition, technology, society, and planetary systems.  
Rather than optimizing for speed, extraction, or engagement, these algorithms optimize for coherence, responsibility, resonance, and shared meaning.

Each paper provides:  
- Formal definitions  
- Mathematical models  
- Pseudocode  
- Real-world use cases  
- Failure modes  
- Ethical considerations

## The Ten Missing Foundational Algorithms

### **1. Coherence Algorithm (κ-Stabilization)**  
An algorithm for detecting, measuring, and restoring coherence across interacting systems. Functions as a feedback stabilizer, preventing fragmentation and runaway divergence in complex environments.

### **2. Temporal Alignment Algorithm (τ-Responsiveness)**  
A cross-timescale optimization method that integrates short-term action with long-term stability. Penalizes temporal harm and rewards actions that preserve future coherence.

### **3. Meaning Recognition Algorithm (Σ-Filtering)**  
Separates noise from significance by measuring semantic, contextual, and relational weight. Designed to preserve meaning under high information density.

### **4. Multi-Reality Reconciliation Algorithm**  
A method for mapping divergent belief-worlds, identifying contradiction points, and reconstructing shared baselines without coercion or collapse.

### **5. Cognitive Resonance Algorithm**  
Retunes environments, workflows, and interfaces to align human cognition with context and purpose. Reduces cognitive load and restores perceptual coherence.

### **6. Cooperative Intelligence Protocol**  
A non-competitive multi-agent coordination protocol that maximizes global coherence rather than local reward. Enables cooperation without centralization.

### **7. Ethical Energy Allocation Algorithm**  
Allocates resources based on systemic responsibility, reciprocity, and planetary health rather than extraction or market dominance.

### **8. Attention Ecology Algorithm**  
Models attention as a finite, regenerative resource. Regulates distribution, load, and recovery to prevent mass-scale cognitive detuning.

### **9. Meaning-Preserving Compression Algorithm**  
Compresses information while retaining conceptual relationships, salience, and context. A foundational component for coherent information ecosystems.

### **10. Coherent Multi-Agent Governance Algorithm**  
A dynamic governance model that monitors ethical drift, corrects systemic imbalances, and maintains accountability across distributed agents.

## Purpose  
These algorithms form the missing foundation of a civilization capable of sustaining itself under accelerating complexity. They define the next required layer of intelligence: systems that maintain coherence at scale.  
This collection is the first formal articulation of these algorithmic primitives.
