# Nadine Squires — Independent Research Archive  

**Focus:** Ethical Intelligence • Coherence Theory • AI Alignment • Systems Ethics  

This repository is a living archive of original research exploring the unification of ethics, energy, and intelligence.  
Each paper develops aspects of a single foundational thesis: that coherence — the measurable harmony between systems — is the basis of both intelligence and morality.
