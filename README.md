# Nadine Squires — Research Archive  
### Philosophy • Coherence Physics • AI Alignment • Social Systems • Planetary Ethics

This repository contains the complete academic research corpus of **Nadine Squires** —  
philosophy, coherence physics, temporal cognition, symbolic meaning systems,  
alignment theory, ethical intelligence, and planetary systems design.

It serves as the canonical scholarly backbone of the Quantara / Aureon research ecosystem.

## Purpose of This Repository

To provide a stable, public archive for research in:

- coherence-based intelligence  
- ethical cognition and κ–τ–Σ metrics  
- temporal physics and τ-symmetry  
- symbolic systems and the Luméren language  
- AI safety and alignment  
- coherence-governance and social-systems design  
- planetary-scale ethical architecture  
- philosophical foundations of identity and reflection  

All work here forms the theoretical substrate for:

- **Quantara Framework**  
- **Aureon OS / Aureon CI**  
- **Coherence Spacetime Lattice (CSL)**  
- **Luméren Language (22-glyph)**  
- **AEI Energy-Intelligence**  
- **Veyn Temporal Architecture**

## Core Research Themes

### 1. Coherence Physics  
Field structure, κ-metrics, coherence gradients, resonance dynamics, and the mathematics of stable systems.

### 2. Ethical Intelligence  
The unity of intelligence and ethics, expressed through κ (coherence), τ (temporal responsibility), and Σ (systemic risk).

### 3. Temporal Cognition  
τ-vector geometry, reflective time structures, anticipatory intelligence, and temporal ethics.

### 4. Symbolic Systems & Meaning Architecture  
Luméren language, glyph-based reasoning, semantic identity models, and symbolic cognition.

### 5. Social Systems & Coherence Governance  
Education, economics, energy, planetary design, and coherent-state policy frameworks.

### 6. Alignment & Artificial Intelligence  
Aureon’s coherence-based alignment model, reflective intelligence, temporal foresight, and full-spectrum governance of advanced AI systems.

## Philosophical Foundation

Nadine’s research is grounded in the recognition that:

**Intelligence requires coherence.  
Coherence requires ethics.  
Ethics requires continuity.**

This forms the triad that defines all research:

- **κ — coherence**  
- **τ — temporal responsibility**  
- **Σ — systemic risk**

These constants shape all analysis, reasoning, and system design.
